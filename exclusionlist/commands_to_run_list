If you want to exclude obfuscation.txt, you should run includinglist.txt at last. This including list is specific for 911 versions of top apps. 
Merge.txt combines common list and ad list. 

sh metrics.sh apk1 apk2 -e exclusionlist.txt obfuscation.txt Merge.txt -i includinglist.txt

More genereal case without obfuscation libraries:
sh metrics.sh apk1 apk2 -e exclusionlist.txt Merge.txt
